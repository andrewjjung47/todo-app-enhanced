# todo-app-enhanced
Add extra features on todo-app that I've work on for Udacity's Javascript Design Patterns course project.
At the end of the course, my todo-app includes features such as edit button, priority button, and adding ' -- done '
after finished tasks.

TODO list
  - Let the user set the priority status when creating the todo item.
  - Let users filter or sort by priority status.
  - Add a recycle bin for recovering deleted todos.
  - Add colors, so people can associate different todos with each other.
  - Add labels for sorting and filtering.
